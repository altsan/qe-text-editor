QE Text Editor
==============

  QE is a simple text editor loosely modelled after IBM's E Editor and 
  Aaron Lawrence's AE.  It is written using Qt4 and is therefore
  reasonably cross-platform.

  The philosophy behind QE is to provide a simple tool for quickly
  reading and/or editing text files.  It is not a programmer's editor,
  word processor, or document manager.  As such, it doesn't provide
  developer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, folding,
  compiler integration, or anything else that could get in the user's
  way, clutter up the interface, or cause lengthy load times.

  What it does aim to provide is the essentials for viewing and editing
  plain text.  This includes straightforward yet flexible search and
  replace, a go-to-line feature, basic printing support, the ability to
  read text files in different encodings, and full support for displaying
  Unicode text.

Installation
------------

### OS/2

  Make sure you have the following runtime packages installed (either the
  WarpIN or yum/rpm distributions):
  - Qt4 runtime version 4.7.3 or later
  - kLIBC (LIBC066.DLL) and LIBGCC (GCC1.DLL)

  Copy QE.EXE to a directory in your PATH, and QE.HLP to a directory in your
  HELP path.  Create a program object for QE.EXE if you wish.

### Windows

  Create a directory for QE and copy QE.EXE into it. Create a shortcut for
  QE.EXE.

  If you do not have the Qt4 and GCC/MingW 4.8.2 runtime libraries installed,
  you must also extract the contents of qe_win32-mingw-qt4_libs.zip either
  into the same directory, or to a directory on your PATH.

  To enable online help support, copy QE.QCH and QE.QHC into the same
  directory as QE.EXE. If you do not have Qt installed system-wide, you must
  also extract the contents of qe_win32-mingw-qt4_assistant.zip either into
  the same directory, or to a directory on your PATH.

### Linux

  Make sure the Qt4 and gcc runtime libraries are installed (using your
  distribution's package manager), along with QtAssistant if you want online
  help support.

  Copy `qe` into a pathed directory (such as /usr/local/bin), along with
  `qe.qch` and `qe.qhc` if you want online help support.


Building from Source
--------------------

GCC, GNU Make, and the Qt4 development libraries for your platform are 
required.  As long as these are all installed correctly, building the
executable should be as simple as running `qmake qe.pro` followed by `make`
(or `make release` under Windows, if you are building the non-debug version).

Building the help is somewhat more complicated.  The help file source is in
IBM IPF format.  Under OS/2 this is compiled to HLP using the IPFC compiler:
run `ipfc qe.ipf` from inside the `help` subdirectory.  

However, on Windows and Linux the help must be converted to QtAssistant
format, which involves converting the IPF file to HTML and then running
`qcollectiongenerator`.  The script `makehtml.cmd` performs the first part of
this task; it is written in REXX and has been confirmed to work with classic
REXX under OS/2, and Regina REXX under Windows.  It also requires the SED 
utility (GNU sed or the equivalent) to run.  This script runs `qe.ipf` 
through the SED script `ipfhtml.sed`, splits the resulting output into 
single-section HTML files, and ensures that any IPF links are converted to 
the proper URIs.  Once this is done, you will have a series of `qe.*.html` 
files; running `qcollectiongenerator qe.qhcp -o qe.qhc` should then generate 
the final QtAssistant help files.
